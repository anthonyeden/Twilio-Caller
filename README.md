![Automatic Calls with Twilio](https://mediarealm.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Twilio-Dead-Air-Caller-PFA.jpg)

This utility uses Twilioâ€™s Programmable Voice service as an inexpensive way of triggering phone calls via an API. It's designed to work with Broadcast Silence Detection software such as [Pira.CZ](http://pira.cz/show.asp?art=silence) and [Pathfinder](http://www.pathfinderpc.com).

## Startup options:

You can start this application using any of these command line parameters:

	--call=+61288063416 (the number to send the call to - full international format)
	--from=+61288063416 (the number to originate the call from - must be registered in Twilio)
	--message="Your radio station is off the air." (the message to read out)
	--messagerepeat=2

The options "call" and "message" are mandatory. The options "from" and "messagerepeat" can also be set in the __config.json__ file, but specifying them on startup will override the defaults.

## Setup Instructions:

A detailed setup guide is available on the Media Realm website: [Automatic Off-Air Phone Calls with Twilio: Get a call when you're off-the-air](https://mediarealm.com.au/articles/2017/04/offair-alarm-phone-caller-twilio/).
